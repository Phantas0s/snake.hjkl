A snake game for me to learn Clojure. The goal is to use HJKL to move the snake, for people to learn how to use HJKL as arrow key (useful for Vim and many other CLIs).

The game is from here: https://github.com/coldnew/snake.cljs

From there, I'll implement more option and try to make the game a bit more fun.

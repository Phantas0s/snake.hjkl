# Snake -HJKL->

This is a simple snake game where you *must* use the keys `h`, `j`, `k` and `l` in order to eat some pills.

[You can play it right now if you click here](https://matthieucneude.com/snake/).

This game is based on a true story.

## Why using the keys h,j,k and l?

In many CLI and specifically Vim, you can use the keys `hjkl` to move around, instead of using the arrow keys.

The controls are:

* `h` left
* `j` down
* `k` up
* `l` right

Using `hjkl` won't oblige you to move your hands to reach the arrow keys. It might sound silly, but it's really nice when you're used to it.

To teach people to do so, I developed this Snake game where you must use `hjkl` to move the snake.

I speak about all of that in more details in my blog article [Is Vim Really Not For You? A Beginner Guide](https://thevaluable.dev/vim-for-beginnners/).

## Inspiration

I used a lot of the code from [this snake](https://github.com/coldnew/snake.cljs).

## That's all?

This is my first ClojureScript project. It helped me learn the language, and it pushed me to think about functional stuff, like pure function, states and such.
